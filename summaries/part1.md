# Knowledge Graphs — Week 1

## Summary

A knowledge graph (KG) represents knowledge using a graph-based structure.
Well-known examples include the Google Knowledge Graph, which powers search
knowledge panels, and the Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT),
which models world events. Knowledge graphs are commonly defined as labeled,
multi-relational, directed graphs.

Domain-specific knowledge is typically modeled using ontologies, though there is
no single universally accepted definition or representation of a knowledge
graph. The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a widely adopted standard for
defining KG schemas, representing knowledge as triples consisting of a subject,
predicate, and object. As knowledge graphs grow more complex, their schemas and
vocabularies expand into layered semantic models, often referred to as the
semantic web “layer cake.”

Community-wide standards help maintain clarity and interoperability across
complex knowledge graphs. Due to their visual and structured nature, knowledge
graphs are intuitive for humans and have become foundational tools for modeling
real-world data in artificial intelligence applications.
