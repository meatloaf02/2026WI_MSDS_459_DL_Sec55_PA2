# Timescale (Tiger Data)

## Summary

On June 17, 2025, Timescale rebranded as Tiger Data while continuing to maintain
its original open-source product, TimescaleDB. TimescaleDB is a time-series
database built on top of PostgreSQL that significantly accelerates analytical
queries compared to standard PostgreSQL or MySQL, particularly for datasets
containing millions of records such as those generated by IoT systems.

TimescaleDB achieves its performance gains through the use of “hypertables,”
which partition large tables into smaller, more manageable chunks while
preserving a unified logical view of the data. This architecture also improves
ingestion speed by organizing data into time-based buckets rather than inserting
into a single monolithic table.

Another advantage is that the classic open-source version of TimescaleDB is
licensed under Apache 2.0, allowing users to self-host it via Docker either
on-premises or in their own cloud environment at no cost.

However, there are several important limitations to consider for a term project.
Since becoming a private company, Tiger Data has reduced support for the
open-source version and encourages migration to its paid Tiger Cloud offering.
Additionally, the licensing model has evolved to differentiate between free and
paid features, and the free version imposes a 750MB database size limit, which
may be restrictive for data-intensive projects.
